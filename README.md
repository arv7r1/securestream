# SecureStream
## Real-Time Application Log Monitoring & Incident Alerting Platform

SecureStream is a real-time application log monitoring and incident alerting platform built using **Python, Apache Kafka, Docker, and AWS**.

The platform generates application logs, securely publishes them to Apache Kafka using **mutual TLS (mTLS)**, processes the events in near real time using a containerized Python consumer running on **AWS ECS/Fargate**, stores application logs in **Amazon S3**, detects incidents, processes them asynchronously using **Amazon SQS and AWS Lambda**, and sends email notifications using **Amazon SNS**.

---

# 1. Problem Statement

Modern applications generate large volumes of logs across multiple services.

Manually reviewing these logs makes it difficult to quickly identify:

- HTTP server errors
- failed API requests
- authentication failures
- slow API responses
- critical application errors

SecureStream demonstrates how application events can be processed in near real time using an **event-driven cloud architecture**.

The platform automatically:

- generates application events
- streams events through Apache Kafka
- detects application incidents
- stores historical logs
- queues incidents for asynchronous processing
- stores incident records
- sends email alerts
- secures Kafka communication using certificates

                                |
                         +------+------+
                         |             |
                         v             v

                                  Email Alert
```

Kafka uses two SSL listeners:

```text
9093   -> Public Kafka listener used by the Python producer

19093  -> Private Kafka listener used by the ECS/Fargate consumer
```

The private Kafka listener is accessible only from the ECS consumer security group.

# 4. Application Log Generation

The Python producer generates simulated application events for multiple services.

Example services:

```text
checkout-api
payment-api
authentication-service
inventory-api
```

Each generated event contains fields such as:

```json
{
  "event_id": "unique-event-id",
  "timestamp": "UTC timestamp",
  "service": "payment-api",
  "environment": "production",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "status_code": 503,
  "response_time_ms": 3900,
  "message": "Service request failed"
}
```

The producer continuously generates events with different:

- service names
- HTTP status codes
- response times
- log levels
- application messages

---

# 5. Kafka Event Streaming

The Python producer publishes application events to the Kafka topic:

```text
application.logs
```

Apache Kafka runs inside a Docker container hosted on an **Amazon EC2 instance**.

The producer connects to Kafka through:

```text
Port 9093
```

The Kafka EC2 security group restricts access to this port to the producer's allowed public IP address.

---

# 6. Mutual TLS Security

Kafka communication is secured using **mutual TLS authentication**.

Certificates were created for:

```text
Kafka Broker
Python Producer
Python Consumer
```

All certificates are signed by a custom Certificate Authority.

The producer uses:

```text
producer.crt
producer.key
ca.crt
```

The consumer uses:

```text
consumer.crt
consumer.key
ca.crt
```

The Kafka broker uses its own server certificate and private key.

With mutual TLS:

```text
Client verifies Kafka broker certificate
                +
Kafka broker verifies client certificate
```

This prevents unauthorized clients from publishing or consuming Kafka messages.

---

# 7. Negative Security Test

A separate producer test was executed without providing a valid client certificate.

Kafka rejected the connection with a TLS error similar to:

```text
certificate required
```

This verified that Kafka was correctly enforcing client-certificate authentication.

The test script is located at:

```text
producer/test_no_certificate.py
```

---

# 8. ECS/Fargate Consumer

The Python Kafka consumer is containerized using Docker.

The deployment flow is:

```text
consumer.py
     |
     v
Docker Image
     |
     v
Amazon ECR
     |
     v
ECS Task Definition
     |
     v
AWS Fargate
```

The consumer runs continuously inside ECS/Fargate without requiring a dedicated application server.

The ECS consumer connects to Kafka through the EC2 private DNS address using:

```text
Port 19093
```

This communication occurs inside the AWS VPC.

---

# 9. Secure Certificate Retrieval with AWS Secrets Manager

Kafka client certificates are **not stored inside the Docker image**.

Instead, they are stored securely in AWS Secrets Manager.

Secret name:

```text
securestream-kafka-client-certs
```

The secret contains Base64-encoded versions of:

```text
ca.crt
consumer.crt
consumer.key
```

When the ECS container starts:

```text
AWS Secrets Manager
        |
        v
ECS Task Role
        |
        v
Python Consumer
        |
        v
Decode Base64 data
        |
        v
/tmp/certs/ca.crt
/tmp/certs/consumer.crt
/tmp/certs/consumer.key
        |
        v
Kafka mTLS Connection
```

This prevents sensitive private keys from being embedded inside the Docker image.

---

# 10. Application Log Storage

Every application event consumed from Kafka is stored in Amazon S3.

The logs are organized by application service.

Example S3 structure:

```text
logs/
|
|-- checkout-api/
|
|-- payment-api/
|
|-- authentication-service/
|
|-- inventory-api/
```

Each event is stored using its unique event ID.

Example:

```text
logs/payment-api/<event-id>.json
```

This provides historical storage for previously processed application events.

---

# 11. Incident Detection

Each Kafka event is evaluated using predefined incident detection rules.

An incident is generated when one or more of the following conditions occur:

```text
HTTP status code >= 500

Response time > 3000 ms

Log level == CRITICAL
```

Examples of detected incidents include:

- HTTP 500 errors
- HTTP 503 errors
- slow API responses
- critical application errors

The detector can identify multiple incident reasons for the same event.

---

# 12. Amazon SQS Incident Queue

When the consumer detects an incident, it sends the event to:

```text
securestream-incidents
```

Amazon SQS decouples the Kafka consumer from downstream incident processing.

Instead of waiting for alert processing to finish, the consumer can continue processing additional Kafka events.

The flow becomes:

```text
Kafka
   |
   v
ECS Consumer
   |
   v
Incident Detected
   |
   v
Amazon SQS
```

---

# 13. Dead-Letter Queue

The incident queue is connected to a Dead-Letter Queue:

```text
securestream-incident-dlq
```

The configured maximum receive count is:

```text
3
```

If a message repeatedly fails processing, it can be moved to the Dead-Letter Queue.

This prevents problematic messages from repeatedly interrupting normal incident processing.

---

# 14. AWS Lambda Incident Processing

AWS Lambda is triggered by messages arriving in the SQS incident queue.

The Lambda function performs the following operations:

1. Receives the SQS message
2. Parses the incident JSON
3. Stores the incident in Amazon S3
4. Publishes an alert to Amazon SNS

Incident records are stored under:

```text
incidents/
```

Example structure:

```text
incidents/
|
|-- checkout-api/
|
|-- payment-api/
|
|-- authentication-service/
|
|-- inventory-api/
```

Example incident object:

```text
incidents/payment-api/<event-id>.json
```

---

# 15. Amazon SNS Email Alerts

AWS Lambda publishes incident notifications to the SNS topic:

```text
securestream-critical-alerts
```

A confirmed email subscription receives notifications when an application incident occurs.

The alert flow is:

```text
Incident
   |
   v
Amazon SQS
   |
   v
AWS Lambda
   |
   v
Amazon SNS
   |
   v
Email Alert
```

This notification mechanism could later be extended to systems such as:

- Slack
- Microsoft Teams
- PagerDuty
- ServiceNow
- SMS
- automated remediation systems

---

# 16. AWS Network Security

Kafka uses separate listeners for producer and consumer communication.

## Producer to Kafka

```text
Python Producer
      |
      | mTLS
      v
EC2 Kafka :9093
```

Port `9093` is restricted by the Kafka EC2 security group.

## ECS to Kafka

```text
ECS Consumer
      |
      | mTLS
      v
EC2 Kafka :19093
```

Port `19093` is restricted to:

```text
securestream-consumer-sg
```

The ECS consumer itself does not require any inbound application ports.

---

# 17. IAM Security

IAM roles are used so applications do not need hardcoded AWS credentials.

## ECS Task Role

The ECS application task role allows the consumer to perform operations such as:

```text
S3 PutObject

SQS SendMessage

SecretsManager GetSecretValue
```

## ECS Task Execution Role

The ECS execution role is responsible for infrastructure operations such as:

```text
Pulling Docker images from Amazon ECR

Sending container logs to CloudWatch
```

This separates application permissions from ECS infrastructure permissions.

---

# 18. CloudWatch Logging

The ECS/Fargate consumer sends its stdout and stderr logs to Amazon CloudWatch.

CloudWatch Log Group:

```text
/ecs/securestream-consumer
```

CloudWatch was used to verify events such as:

```text
Loading Kafka certificates from AWS Secrets Manager...

Kafka certificates loaded successfully.

Application events received

S3 objects stored

Incidents sent to SQS
```

CloudWatch also provides centralized troubleshooting information for the running ECS task.

```

Certificate and private-key files are intentionally excluded from the repository.

---

# 20. Local Setup

Create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# 21. Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for AWS and Kafka configuration.

Example:

```text
AWS_REGION=us-east-2

S3_BUCKET_NAME=<your-s3-bucket-name>

SQS_QUEUE_URL=<your-sqs-queue-url>

KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER=<kafka-server>:9093
```

The actual `.env` file is intentionally excluded from Git.

---

# 22. Running the Producer

Start the Python producer using:

```bash
python producer/producer.py
```

Successful Kafka publishing produces output similar to:

```text
SecureStream Kafka producer started...

Kafka broker: <kafka-server>:9093

checkout-api | INFO | 200 | 3469 ms

DELIVERED | topic=application.logs | partition=0 | offset=0
```

The `DELIVERED` message confirms that Kafka successfully accepted the event.

---

# 23. Running the Consumer Locally

The consumer can also be run locally for testing:

```bash
python consumer/consumer.py
```

During local development, the consumer uses Kafka certificates stored in the local certificate directory.

When running in ECS:

```text
KAFKA_CERT_SOURCE=secretsmanager
```

causes the consumer to retrieve its certificates from AWS Secrets Manager instead.

---

# 24. Unit Testing

Incident detection logic is tested using Pytest.

Run:

```bash
python -m pytest -v
```

Tests include:

```text
Normal application request

HTTP server error

Slow API response

Multiple incident conditions
```

All implemented detector tests successfully passed.

---

# 25. Docker Build

Build the consumer Docker image using:

```bash
docker build -t securestream-consumer -f consumer/dockerfile .
```

The resulting image is pushed to Amazon ECR.

Example deployment flow:

```text

    |
    v
Docker Build
    |
    v
Amazon ECR
    |
    v
ECS/Fargate

# 29. Repository Security

Sensitive information is intentionally excluded from Git.

The `.gitignore` prevents files such as the following from being committed:

```text
.env

.venv/

Python cache files

Pytest cache

Private keys

Certificate signing requests

PKCS12 keystores

Kafka certificate directory

Secrets Manager JSON payload
```

Examples of files that should never be committed include:

```text
*.key

*.p12

ca.key

consumer.key

producer.key

securestream-kafka-secret.json
```

Base64 encoding is not encryption, so Base64-encoded private keys must also be treated as sensitive.
